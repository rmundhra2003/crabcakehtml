<p>
   <h3><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h3>
</br>
    2  tablespoons unsalted butter
</br>
    2 ½  pounds apples, peeled and cored, then cut into wedges (5 large honeycrisps will do it)
</br>
    ¼  teaspoon ground allspice
</br>
    ½  teaspoon ground cinnamon
</br>
    ¼  teaspoon kosher salt
</br>
    ¾  cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
</br>
    2  tablespoons all-purpose flour
</br>
    2  teaspoons cornstarch
</br>
    1  tablespoon apple cider vinegar
</br>
    1  recipe all-purpose pie dough
</br>
    1  egg, lightly beaten
</br>
</p>
<p>
    <h3><strong>PREPARATION</strong></h3>
<p>
    Melt butter in a large saute pan set over medium-high heat and add apples to the pan. Stir to coat fruit with butter and cook,
</p><p>
    stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, whisk together the spices, salt and .75 cup sugar, and sprinkle this over the pan, stirring
</p><p>
    to combine. Lower heat and cook until apples have started to soften, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the flour and
</p><p>
    cornstarch over the apples and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, another 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat, add cider
</p><p>
    vinegar, stir and scrape fruit mixture into a bowl and allow to cool completely. (The fruit mixture will cool faster if spread
</p><p>
    out on a rimmed baking sheet.)
